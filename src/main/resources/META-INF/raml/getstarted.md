# System Account

All users accounts are created with 0 balance, after that they can be credited from System Account. **System Account** is the only one that you may credit directly - I suppose that this case is to be handled by another system - so API has a method to credit/debit System Account.

## User Account

After being created user account can be credited from System Account - it simulates transfering money from outside through System Account.

This should be visible.
