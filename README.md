My customer asked to develop a simple microservice with embedded datastore and RESTful API. The customer had "ostricized" Spring framework (and relatives), for some hidden reasons, so I chose the following tech stack to build the application:
- Vert.x
- Guice
- Jackson
- JDO
- RxJava
- H2 database
- Junit
- slf4j + logback
- Gradle
